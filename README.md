# Learn-C++-in-the-first-week

This is a program I made for calculating quadratic functions, entering the quadratic term coefficients, the primary term coefficients, the constant terms in turn, and you can get an expression and use it for calculation...

The program can identify the plus or minus (or 0) of the values of the coefficients and constants and do a "non-zero fault tolerance" for the quadratic term coefficients. Variables use "double", which can use decimals. It has been proven that there is a bug when entering illegal characters (non-numeric) so that it displays "y=6.95297e-310". After each calculation, you can press any key to evaluate another expression from the new one.
